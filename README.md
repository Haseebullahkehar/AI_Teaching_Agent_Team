# AI Teaching Agent Team 🎓🤖  

## Overview  
Traditional AI models are great at generating educational content, but they struggle with complex, multi-step workflows. This project solves that by building an **AI Teaching Agent Team** that collaborates like a real teaching faculty to create structured learning materials automatically.  

Instead of asking an AI model to generate content separately (like a curriculum, exercises, and resources) and manually compiling them, our **AI Teaching Agents** work together to handle everything seamlessly.  

## How It Works  
The system consists of four specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific task:  

### 🔹 Meet Your AI Teaching Agent Team

1. **🧠 Professor Agent**  
   - Creates a fundamental **knowledge base** in Google Docs  
   - Organizes content with headings and structured sections  
   - Provides detailed explanations and examples  
   - **Output:** A comprehensive document with a table of contents  

2. **🗺️ Academic Advisor Agent**  
   - Designs a **structured learning path**  
   - Includes milestone markers, prerequisites, and estimated time for each topic  
   - **Output:** A visual roadmap document with clear progression paths  

3. **📚 Research Librarian Agent**  
   - Compiles an **organized resource list** with links to academic papers, tutorials, and references  
   - Categorizes resources based on difficulty and relevance  
   - **Output:** A curated list of learning materials with ratings  

4. **✍️ Teaching Assistant Agent**  
   - Develops **interactive exercises** with solutions  
   - Structures practice sections and problem sets  
   - **Output:** A complete workbook with exercises and answer keys  

## Tech Stack 🛠️  
This project is powered by:  

- **[Phidata](https://phidata.ai/)** – Manages AI agent orchestration, memory, and tool integration.  
- **[Composio](https://composio.ai/)** – Connects AI agents with external services like Google Docs, Gmail, and GitHub.  
- **Google Docs API** – Stores and organizes all generated learning materials.  

## Installation & Setup  
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
git clone (https://github.com/Haseebullahkehar/AI_Teaching_Agent_Team)  
cd ai-teaching-agent-team  

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
  
pip install -r requirements.txt    




## Usage  
1. **Provide a topic** (e.g., "Machine Learning Basics").  
2. The AI Teaching Agent Team will:  
   - Generate a structured knowledge base.  
   - Create a roadmap for learning progression.  
   - Curate high-quality resources.  
   - Design exercises and solutions.  
3. All materials are **automatically saved in Google Docs**, eliminating manual work.  

## Future Enhancements 🚀  
- Support for **multi-language learning materials**  
- Integration with **LMS platforms** (Moodle, Blackboard)  
- AI-powered **quiz generation** for automated assessment
